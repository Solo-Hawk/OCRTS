# Year 1 Prototype Project

# NOTICE
This project will be idle for some time as I move in on my course, the development of this game will be used later either as a continued development of this repo or a forked repo that will take over to archive this as my Uni work

# One click RTS
One Click RTS will a simple strategy game that will be built on desktop, then mobile, its focus is simply just simple one action controls to play game.

The idea for a minialistic sort of strategy game where grouping is automatically managed and not even that many varaitions in any field.

For the projec this will be a standard single player game that I may want to try making into a sort of online multiplayer.
